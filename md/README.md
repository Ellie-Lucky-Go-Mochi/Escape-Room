# Escape-Room

## Purpose ##  
This game allows the user to have a virtual escape room experience. The user will need to go through the presented questions in order to escape/pass the game. The questions are generated in a random order and the score is updated based on the correct answers. At the end of the game, the user can see the top 5 scores on the last page, and can get information about the developers.
